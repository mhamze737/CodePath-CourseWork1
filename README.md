## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
YouTube
Well-organized UI: It is very well-structured; videos can be categorized as recommended, trending, etc.
Comment section for creators: Encourages interaction between the creators and their audience.

TikTok
Specific feed for people you follow: This makes all the content relevant to your target.
Infinite scroll: The moment you scroll down, there's always some more, making the experience infinite and addictive.

Snapchat
Location view: allows you to view the location of your friends, which is great to meet on campus or find people around you.


App Idea: College Buddy Finder
Concept: This website will help the college student find a study buddy, interact with classmates, and find people around them to study together. The app will facilitate easy searching and locating people in the same courses, similar studying habits, or those that are in the same area of campus.

Features:
Location Sharing: Similar to Snapchat's location feature, students can choose to share their location, and the app will show them who is around for possible meetups or study groups. It would work in a helpful way for students to connect with other people on campus.

School Verification: Much like Snapchats's student groups, users would need to verify their school e-mail in order to ensure that only verified students can join. Upon verification, one will be able to join school-specific study partner groups or course groups.

Customizable Study Preferences: Users can specify preferred study times, subjects, and learning styles. The app can then match them with studying buddies with similar goals or needs.
